* Deploy to Now

DEMO WEB SITE: https://output-82pd1kgu0.now.sh/

NOTE: You need node >= 10

## Intructions
    
  - Clone the repository
  - In project root, run:
```js
// Install required dependencies
$ npm install

// Develop mode
$ npm run watch

// Build develop mode
$ npm run build

// Build for production in output folder
$ npm run build:prod

// Watch production mode
$ npm run watch:prod

// Deploy to now (you have to have an account)
$ npm run deploy
```

## Edit content and add more sections
If you want to edit the page content you have to edit the file: nunjuckspages.js, is in the project root. 
If you want to add more sections, in the previous file there is an array with sections. 
The logic is:
* The banner (first section) is a separated section.
* All others sections, if they are odd will take one style, and if they are even, will take other style. (talking about position number)
* The odd sections have an image in the right side and the text in the left side
* The even sections have an image in the left side and the text in the right side
